This python (3) script commits exported scrobbles (tsv) from last.fm to a git
repository.

You need the exported json/tsv zip from the settings/dataexporter tool (which
seems to have been removed from the last version of last.fm?)

Usage:

    $ unzip lastfm-export.zip
    $ mkdir output
    $ cd output
    $ git init
    $ cd ..
    $ python lastfm-git.py output data
